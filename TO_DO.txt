 * Track route w/ compass direction (top street map)
 * Timeline/playback timeline
 * Videos
* Can change "day" associated w/ map
* Time difference around the world
* Refresh map every minute

11/8/14 - Implementation Details

* Post to server -- packet from Pi
* Heroku reads + updates database
* Post to server for web forms - server takes action
* Identify Pi/Form posts, unique ID
* Dynamic DNS?
* What is GET for?
* Direct write to SQL or need to go through POST on nodejs side?
 * Need to go through POST, b/c otherwise SQL database info is embedded into app (not safe)
* Youtube is pure JS https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference
* https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Grouping_Sets
* When you hit GO, increments view count; MAC address as ID? 
* group by date + hashtag + city --> number and earliest 
* convert GPS to city prior to entry

11/8/14 - User scenario

refresh page
group by {city + date + hashtag}
  get count(sum)
  earliest time stamp (earliest function?)
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/queries-table-expressions.html
when click on hotspot
  make new table based off of group by
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-createtableas.html

android sends request for all hashtags from today at specific location for auto complete
  get request --> server pulls info from database
  --> sends back to android (how??)

update array based off of FIND unique stream ID + append to array

currval() is "local" to your current connection

need to pull next stream ID from database (GET request from Android)

11/8/14 - Database agenda

make local database
make database with tables, subtables? based off of current data structure
add fake data
remotely add data (pi or from local)
display data + auto update each time remotely added (maybe not separate data query but locally add for view update)
search feature to group + display as group 
sub search : display as more group (sub table?) - 5 min increments/location
on video display: increment viewer count (or figure out how to use Youtube)
Youtube Javascript API -- pull stored video from search query, control playback time
Mapbox API -- how to redisplay info; how to make GPS --> city
Have Android get city name (less Mapbox API usage?)
Android needs to send UTC time
local DB? -- client side
separate info collector page?

11/8/14 - Homework

pi send Gchat or Twitter + send put request to database
pi uploads rtmp to youtube livestream (or local?) 
you stare at youtube, see person; can change lock/unlock option --> push back to pi
